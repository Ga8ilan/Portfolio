            Hi! I'm Edgar Castaneda. I study computer science at //Northeastern Univeristy// and
            I'm concentrating in Software! I'm passionate about the things I build and I truly
            enjoy spending time working on my work. I'm always excited to learn new things and
            //bring my very best to whatever I need to do//. 

            I love connecting and talking to new people so please don't hesitate to contact me.
            I'm open to building new things and helping out on projects, and I'm always down for
            just a simple chat.

            I've been programming for the past two years and I've learned so much. I've recently
            become a fellow ColorStack and I'm excited to join and experience even more new things.
