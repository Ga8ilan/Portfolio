                    Hi! I'm Edgar Castaneda. I study computer science at <strong>Northeastern Univeristy</strong> and
                    I'm concentrating in Software! I'm passionate about the things I build and I truly
                    enjoy spending time working on my work. I'm always excited to learn new things
                    and <strong>bring my very best to whatever I need to do</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love connecting and talking to new people so please don't hesitate to contact me.
                    I'm open to building new things and helping out on projects, and I'm always down for
                    just a simple chat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been programming for the past two years and I've learned so much. I've recently
                    become a fellow at <strong>ColorStack</strong> and I'm excited to join and experience even more new things.
                </p>
